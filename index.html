        love to paint. It is my hobby. I paint with water colours. I like to
        paint beautiful landscapes. When we go on holidays to different places
        like hill stations, desert areas, river banks or the countryside, I
        always take my art material with me. I like to sit and paint a scenery
        as I watch it. The painting then is very vivid and comes alive. I find
        my hobby refreshing to me. I keep all my paintings carefully. I have
        participated in different art exhibitions and painting competitions at
        school and at state level events, and won prizes too.
        but also  reading, story writing, sports, philately,  all be hobbies
